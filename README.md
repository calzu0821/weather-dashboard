# weather-dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard application designed to enable users to look up a city and view its present and upcoming weather conditions. The purpose behind creating this tool is to aid travelers in planning their trips more efficiently by offering them the most recent weather information for numerous cities. The dashboard uses the OpenWeather API to obtain weather data for cities and stores the information for future use via localStorage. The project enabled me to gain experience in working with APIs and using localStorage to retain data.

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/calzu0821/weather-dashboard.git

3. Register for a new API key from OpenWeatherMap.

4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API key as API_KEY=yourapikey.

3. Navigate to the repository's directory using the command:

 cd weather-dashboard

5. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

2. The dashboard will display the city's current weather conditions, including the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
3. The dashboard will also display a 5-day forecast that shows the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
4. The searched city will be added to the search history, which is stored in localStorage.
